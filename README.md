# First year web design project. 


You have been tasked with creating a website for your friend who is getting married. The aim here is to provide needed information as to the wedding as well as fun details such as backstory of the couple. This means that the website must be aesthetically pleasing and well-laid out. 


## Outline
The home page should be relatively simple, well laid out and clean without much clutter. It should be easy for the user to navigate to any other page from the home page. 
You may be creative and implement elements as you please. However, ensure that you abide by best practice and that your site is HTML5 compliant. In the areas mentioned below, you may only use the implementation as stated explicitly.

1.	Menu implementation 
2.	Page layout
3.	Resource linking
4.	Page content  
5.	Page layout
6.	Background

In addition to the requirements mentioned above, you will also be graded on the following:
1.	Professional and consistent look and feel.
2.  Ease of use (navigation throughout the website).
3.	Naming standards applied in coding.
4.	Proper use of HTML5 and CSS in combination.
5.  Good file structure.

Please view the appendices below for guidance on the expected layout and structure. This should also give an indication of the expected level of detail. You are not required to make an exact replica of the implementation provided. Your design must, as a basic requirement, be comparable to the samples.
An immediate fail will be awarded to any student that makes use of templates in this project.

Important aspects to remember
1.	The feel of a website for a wedding is very important for the bride.
2.	The couple loves music and videos and wants to share their favourites on the website. (Which to use is up to you)
3.	When you RSVP for the wedding there should be a form with a variety of questions such as diet options, gift type etc.
4.	Only people who were invited should be able to login into the website and RSVP.
5.	Clearly display every aspect of your HTML and CSS knowledge with a variety of techniques.
6.	None of the components needs to be functional. Instead, components only show a representation of what it would look like and process flow for the website (ease of use is very important).
7.	You need to have a minimum of 5 different web pages.
