                        A few years ago, I flew to Rome for an archaeological dig and used my field kit as my second carry-on. 
                        Well, just my luck: after a 10-hour plane ride, I discovered the airline lost my luggage. 
                        After filing my report, I went to my hostel to have a shower and take a long nap. 
                        After check in, I asked the girl at the counter where to go to buy supplies and clothes etc, explaining to her my experience with my luggage.

                        the clerk was telling me they didn't have any more clean towels,
                        he cutest guy I have ever seen tapped my shoulder, telling me that he had some I could borrow. 
                        He was visiting from Ireland, and he always brought his own towels while traveling. 
                        Apparently, he heard my story earlier and felt really bad for me, and wished there was something he could do. So we went to his room together to get them, and along the way he invited me out for a drink to help improve my day.
